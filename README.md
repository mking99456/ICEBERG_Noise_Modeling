# ICEBERG_Noise_Modeling
#
## Project Overview
#The ICEBERG Noise Modeling Project is a methodology for characterizing and simulating the electronics noise in the ICEBERG LArTPC at Fermilab. Following this procedure, we will model other sources of background (such as Ar-39 radiological deposits) for low-energy events (such as supernova neutrinos). ICEBERG is a small TPC serving as a proof-of-concept for our methods before we apply them to the DUNE experiment.
